Featuring three presentations by

The Geezers Club - The Geezers

    The Geezers, a club for over 50's men in Tower Hamlets, present their ideas
    and research on sustainable energy solutions.

Sketchpatch Livecoding - Davide Della Cassa and Sophie Macdonald

    Livecodelab is a special secret place where you can make fancy "on-the-fly"
    3d visuals and play awesomely offbeat (literally) sounds.  "On-the-fly" meaning:
    as you type. Type just three letters: "box", and boom!  a box appears. No
    clicking play, no waiting, no nothing.

Stencil - Paul Nikkel

    A eurorack base system comprised of modular analogue video synthesisers
    combined with audio waveform generators. The audio signal is manipulated and
    converted into RGB video.The result is a visualisation of sound synthesised from
    audio signals and creating an incomplete visual artefact of the original audio.

And opendorks from anyone with something to talk about for up to 10 minutes (let
us know beforehand if you can)
