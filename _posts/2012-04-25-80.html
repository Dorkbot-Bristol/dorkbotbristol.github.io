Featuring three presentations by<br/>
<br/>
The Geezers Club - The Geezers<br/>
<br/>
    The Geezers, a club for over 50's men in Tower Hamlets, present their ideas<br/>
    and research on sustainable energy solutions.<br/>
<br/>
Sketchpatch Livecoding - Davide Della Cassa and Sophie Macdonald<br/>
<br/>
    Livecodelab is a special secret place where you can make fancy "on-the-fly"<br/>
    3d visuals and play awesomely offbeat (literally) sounds.  "On-the-fly"
meaning:<br/>
    as you type. Type just three letters: "box", and boom!  a box appears. No<br/>
    clicking play, no waiting, no nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Stencil - Paul Nikkel<br/>
<br/>
    A eurorack base system comprised of modular analogue video synthesisers<br/>
    combined with audio waveform generators. The audio signal is manipulated and<br/>
    converted into RGB video.The result is a visualisation of sound synthesised
from<br/>
    audio signals and creating an incomplete visual artefact of the original
audio.<br/>
<br/>
And opendorks from anyone with something to talk about for up to 10 minutes (let<br/>
us know beforehand if you can)<br/>
