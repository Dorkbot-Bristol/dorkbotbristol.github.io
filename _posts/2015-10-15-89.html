<b>==== Di Mainstone ====</b>

Artist, Movician, and researcher, Di Mainstone creates body-centric
sculptures, designed to initiate movement and storytelling. Many of these
wearable artefacts are inspired by technology. Some of them release sound
when handled. Often, they can be modified to create new silhouettes,
environments and functionalities. All of them tell a story.

<b>==== Tine Bech ====</b>

Tine is a professional artist and researcher (PhD) using technology to
create stunning large-scale public artworks, interactive spaces,
wearables, and participatory games. Working with programmers,
designers and engineers, her studio creates interactive and playful
projects, and designs that pop up in unexpected places. From bridges
that light up as people pass over them, to live events where
communities swim in clouds of Olympic colours, to battles played on
bicycles in the city, her works actively explore the relationship
between people, technology and space.

<b>==== Becky Stewart ====</b>

Becky is a creative technologist and founding member of Anti-Alias
Labs where she engineers solutions to creative problems, often working
with artists, designers, and musicians. She is also a co-founder of
Codasign, a creative technology education company that runs workshop
teaching kids and adults how to use technology to develop creative
projects.

<b>==== Nicola Plant ====</b>

Nicola is a movement artist, coder and researcher. Her research
interests are human movement and expression, embodiment,
intersubjectivity and the vicarious experience of empathy. Nicolaâ€™s
research asks: What qualities of movement convey the intangible
aspects of human experience? What does it mean to be embodied? How can
technology augment or embody the experience of embodiment?
Specialising in motion capture, she makes movement-based interactive
installations and experiences.
