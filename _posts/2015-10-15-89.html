Artist, Movician, and researcher, Di Mainstone creates body-centric<br/>
sculptures, designed to initiate movement and storytelling. Many of these<br/>
wearable artefacts are inspired by technology. Some of them release sound<br/>
when handled. Often, they can be modified to create new silhouettes,<br/>
environments and functionalities. All of them tell a story.<br/>

Tine is a professional artist and researcher using technology to<br/>
create stunning large-scale public artworks, interactive spaces,<br/>
wearables, and participatory games. Working with programmers,<br/>
designers and engineers, her studio creates interactive and playful<br/>
projects, and designs that pop up in unexpected places. From bridges<br/>
that light up as people pass over them, to live events where<br/>
communities swim in clouds of Olympic colours, to battles played on<br/>
bicycles in the city, her works actively explore the relationship<br/>
between people, technology and space.<br/>

Becky is a creative technologist and founding member of Anti-Alias<br/>
Labs where she engineers solutions to creative problems, often working<br/>
with artists, designers, and musicians. She is also a co-founder of<br/>
Codasign, a creative technology education company that runs workshop<br/>
teaching kids and adults how to use technology to develop creative<br/>
projects.<br/>

Nicola is a movement artist, coder and researcher. Her research<br/>
interests are human movement and expression, embodiment,<br/>
intersubjectivity and the vicarious experience of empathy. Nicolaâ€™s<br/>
research asks: What qualities of movement convey the intangible<br/>
aspects of human experience? What does it mean to be embodied? How can<br/>
technology augment or embody the experience of embodiment?<br/>
Specialising in motion capture, she makes movement-based interactive<br/>
installations and experiences.<br/>
