<b>==== Sarah Angliss - <a href="http://sarahangliss.com">sarahangliss.com</a> / <a href='https://twitter.com/Therematrix'>@Therematrix</a> ====</b>

A preview of new work with breath sensors that Sarah's been developing at the
Pervasive Media Studio, Bristol. Funded by Arts Council England, it'll be part
of a drop-in participative performance at Vivid Projects, Birmingham during this
year's Supersonic Festival.

A composer, multi-instrumentalist, roboticist and sound historian, Sarah's work
explores her obsessions with defunct machinery, faded variety acts and European
folklore.

documents.

World Wilder Lab is a collective set up by Kasia Molga, Erik Overmeire and Ivan
Henriques. Together with Adrian Godwin we developed a device called PlanEt which
allows us to hack into whispers of plants. Now we are trying to figure out what
plants are saying...

ScanLAB is an ongoing series of projects investigating the use of 3D laser
scanning in architecture, art and film, with subjects ranging from Arctic ice
floes to Mount Pleasant subterranean Mail Rail station.

electrically conductive paint, plus the paint's more "unusual properties".
