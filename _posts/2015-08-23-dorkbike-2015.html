Following the excellent suggestions of Electric Mike and Gordon Joly, the
exciting news is that this year's "Dorkbike" is an easy (and short!) cycle trip
from the Olympic Park to the salvaged neon signs of God's Own Junkyard via
Walthamstow Pumphouse Museum: from noon-2/3pm, approx 10 miles round trip - plus
pedestrian options (details below), and a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/452582228279551/">Facebook event</a> if you want to see who's
coming...

From the Orbit it should be less than 30 min across Hackney Marsh and then
(mostly) via <a href="http://www.leytonpast.info/blackpath.html">"The Black Path"</a> to Walthamstow Pumphouse Museum:

- A former Victorian waste water pumping station with a (small) collection of
vehicles and other items related to "technology and industrial history of the
area [...] now open to the public every Sunday, from 11:00 to 16:00. Entry is
free!"

...then by 2pm we should definitely be able to make it to the salvaged neon
signs of God's Own Junkyard near "Walthamstow Village":

<a href="http://www.godsownjunkyard.co.uk/">http://www.godsownjunkyard.co.uk/</a>

- "Neon art made from found objects, retrieved and renewed waste and lights". We
are open weekends : Friday - 11am to 5pm Saturday - 11am to 9pm Sunday - 11am to
6pm.

The Rolling Scones Cafe is open for food and drinks all weekend." (there's a map
below of a simple quiet route from the Pumphouse Museum to Shernhall Street,
which seems to be the main entrance to Ravenswood Industrial Estate although the
Summit Road gate may also be open at weekends...)

Not got a bike? You could potentially hire a Santander Cycle from the Hackney
side of the Olympic park, or meet us by foot or car around 1pm at Walthamstow
Pumphouse Museum, or 2pm at God's Own Junkyard (around 15 min walk from
Walthamstow Central or Walthamstow Queens Road stations).

NB: You are responsible for your own safety and personal possessions at all
times - the route is mostly flat and away from main roads, but always be aware
of potential hazards and other cyclists and pedestrians. Don't forget to bring a
proper bike lock and spare inner tube if you can get one - plus food and drink
unless you want to rely on cafes at the various stopping points. There are
toilets near the start and most likely near God's Own Junkyard as well, given
that it's next door to <a href="http://www.wildcardbrewery.co.uk/">Wildcard Brewery</a> and <a href="http://www.mothersruin.net/">Mothers Ruin</a>.
