Following the excellent suggestions of Electric Mike and Gordon Joly, the<br/>
exciting news is that this year's "Dorkbike" is an easy (and short!) cycle trip<br/>
from the Olympic Park to the salvaged neon signs of God's Own Junkyard via<br/>
Walthamstow Pumphouse Museum: from noon-2/3pm, approx 10 miles round trip - plus<br/>
pedestrian options (details below), and a <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/events/452582228279551/">Facebook event</a> if
you want to see who's<br/>
coming...<br/>
<br/>
From the Orbit it should be less than 30 min across Hackney Marsh and then<br/>
(mostly) via <a href="http://www.leytonpast.info/blackpath.html">"The Black
Path"</a> to Walthamstow Pumphouse Museum:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.walthamstowpumphousemuseum.org.uk/">http://www.walthamstowpumphousemuseum.org.uk/</a>
<br/>
- A former Victorian waste water pumping station with a (small) collection of<br/>
vehicles and other items related to "technology and industrial history of the<br/>
area [...] now open to the public every Sunday, from 11:00 to 16:00. Entry is<br/>
free!"<br/>
<br/>
...then by 2pm we should definitely be able to make it to the salvaged neon<br/>
signs of God's Own Junkyard near "Walthamstow Village":<br/>

<br/>
- "Neon art made from found objects, retrieved and renewed waste and lights". We<br/>
are open weekends : Friday - 11am to 5pm Saturday - 11am to 9pm Sunday - 11am to<br/>
6pm.<br/>
<br/>
The Rolling Scones Cafe is open for food and drinks all weekend." (there's a map<br/>
below of a simple quiet route from the Pumphouse Museum to Shernhall Street,<br/>
which seems to be the main entrance to Ravenswood Industrial Estate although the<br/>
Summit Road gate may also be open at weekends...)<br/>
<br/>
Not got a bike? You could potentially hire a Santander Cycle from the Hackney<br/>
side of the Olympic park, or meet us by foot or car around 1pm at Walthamstow<br/>
Pumphouse Museum, or 2pm at God's Own Junkyard (around 15 min walk from<br/>
Walthamstow Central or Walthamstow Queens Road stations).<br/>
<br/>
NB: You are responsible for your own safety and personal possessions at all<br/>
times - the route is mostly flat and away from main roads, but always be aware<br/>
of potential hazards and other cyclists and pedestrians. Don't forget to bring a<br/>
proper bike lock and spare inner tube if you can get one - plus food and drink<br/>
unless you want to rely on cafes at the various stopping points. There are<br/>
toilets near the start and most likely near God's Own Junkyard as well, given<br/>
that it's next door to <a href="http://www.wildcardbrewery.co.uk/">Wildcard
Brewery</a> and <a href="http://www.mothersruin.net/">Mothers Ruin</a>.<br/>
