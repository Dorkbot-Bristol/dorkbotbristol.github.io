"How and Why I Built A Machine That 3D Prints Shape-changing Jelly"<br/>
<br/>
Our bodies, and much of the natural world around them, are soft, flexible, and<br/>
change in response to needs. Our human engineering is not like that. Naturally,<br/>
I responded to this by spending 3 years building an open-source UV-curing<br/>
extrusion based 3D printer, to make jelly forms that change shape as the<br/>
temperature around them changes. Since it was funded by the taxpayer though the<br/>
Engineering &amp; Physics Sciences Research Council, I figure it's my duty to<br/>
tell you all what I did with your money.<br/>
<br/>
Scary likes making things, drawing things and knowing things. During a career<br/>
in science communications they got to visit CERN and make a cake in the shape<br/>
of the internet for Cerf and Khan. However, due to an allergy to insufficient<br/>
technical detail they pivoted to do a PhD at the Bristol Centre for Functional<br/>
Nanomaterials. In their spare time they do comedy about science and art about<br/>
science.<br/>

"Fake it ’til you make it - creating digital lies"<br/>
<br/>
#deepfakes and #fakenews are going to destroy us all. Or are they? There’s only<br/>
one way to find out!  Artist Eric Drass aka shardcore demonstrates some of his<br/>
attempts to use neural networks to hasten the inevitable collapse of<br/>
civilisation.<br/>

"A Campfire in the Uncanny Valley"<br/>
<br/>
Horror and hope in tech, and how artists are making ghosts of ourselves by<br/>
mistake.<br/>

"Embodied Interactive Music – work in progress"<br/>
<br/>
The availability of affordable motion capture systems like the Microsoft Kinect<br/>
has sparked a multitude of creative projects. Such MoCap systems are commonly<br/>
employed by artists and designers working with interactive dance where sound,<br/>
rather than informing a dancer’s movement, is generated by it. This project<br/>
highlights the challenges of creating these systems and explores the use of<br/>
organically-inspired digital interfaces. It ultimately questions how<br/>
interactivity might add something to an already-established practise or<br/>
performance, beyond being a mere technical gimmick. The project has been<br/>
realised at Queen Mary University in collaboration with the Music AI company<br/>
MXX.<br/>
<br/>
Sebastian is an artist and researcher working in digital media, sound and<br/>
interactive design. His works have been staged and exhibited internationally in<br/>
galleries, performance halls and music venues, often in collaboration with<br/>
choreographers, writers and theorists. He is currently persuing a PhD in<br/>
Media&amp;Arts Technology at Queen Mary Universities where he researches
embodied<br/>
music creation through motion capture with a focus on digital interfaces.<br/>
