With short talks and demos from...

<b>==== Sian Fan ====</b>

"Seeping Out: Virtuality Beyond the Screen"

Sian Fan will be analysing and exploring how new technologies act as portals
into digital realms. She will explore how the screen sits as a barrier between
two worlds, mediating, interrupting, and ultimately dividing the physical world
from the digital dimension. She will discuss the commonalities between digital
spaces and dream spaces, analysing how both act as distortions of our waking
reality, enabling escapism and for the impossible to be realised, but not
necessarily satisfying.

Sian Fan is an emerging artist working in digital media, installation and
performance. She is currently studying a Fine Art Masters at Central Saint
Martins. Sian works with movement, the female body and technology to explore
and expose what it means to exist, both physically and spiritually. She
explores the relationship between the natural and the digital through 3D
scanning, animation and virtual reality.

<b>==== L H Trevail ====</b>

“A Campfire in the Uncanny Valley”

Horror and hope in tech, and how artists are making ghosts of ourselves by
mistake.

<b>==== Dr. Elif Ozden Yenigun ====</b>

This project has emerged in the career of two researchers as a consequence of
over-priced printers, and high material specs in the aerospace industry
associated with expensive research costs, that lead to innovative artefacts and
affordable self-built 3D printers.

Dr. Elif Ozden Yenigun is a Senior Tutor in textiles at the Royal College of
Art. She is a material scientist interested in nanoengineered aerospace
composites, smart wearables, and 3D textile preforms. Her research focuses on
developing cutting-edge textile-based materials and manufacturing methods that
enable the design of more novel and optimized engineered systems and products.
