"How and Why I Built A Machine That 3D Prints Shape-changing Jelly"

Our bodies, and much of the natural world around them, are soft, flexible, and
change in response to needs. Our human engineering is not like that. Naturally,
I responded to this by spending 3 years building an open-source UV-curing
extrusion based 3D printer, to make jelly forms that change shape as the
temperature around them changes. Since it was funded by the taxpayer though the
Engineering &amp; Physics Sciences Research Council, I figure it's my duty to
tell you all what I did with your money.

Scary likes making things, drawing things and knowing things. During a career
in science communications they got to visit CERN and make a cake in the shape
of the internet for Cerf and Khan. However, due to an allergy to insufficient
technical detail they pivoted to do a PhD at the Bristol Centre for Functional
Nanomaterials. In their spare time they do comedy about science and art about
science.

“A Campfire in the Uncanny Valley”

Horror and hope in tech, and how artists are making ghosts of ourselves by
mistake.
