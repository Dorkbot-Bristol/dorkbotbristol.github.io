Pollie is an artist, activist and game designer who has designed games from the

temporal memory, and exploits the balance of collaboration and competition. The
action takes place at night. Your first strategic move is the clothing you wear.
Players, wearing Flashing LED badges will compete to see who can steal the most
badges from other players. However, the prize you seek may be your downfall!
