Emilie will discuss her PhD work around working with blind and visually impaired<br/>
people using e-textiles. She has been exploring how participants connect
personal<br/>
memories and associations to the specific textures of textiles and how this can
be<br/>
used to create a soft, interactive object.<br/>
