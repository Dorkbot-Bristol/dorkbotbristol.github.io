    <h3><b>==== Sarah Angliss ====</b></h3>
<br/>
    <p>Sarah Angliss explores the sonorities of voices and instruments, revealing and augmenting them with her distinctive and finely wrought electronic techniques. Her debut opera Giant uses eighteenth century instruments, live electronics and the composer's bespoke musical automata as it vividly recalls a disquieting story that resonates through the ages.</p>

    <h3><b>==== Location: <a href="https://www.thesekforde.com/"> The Sekforde</a> ====</b></h3>
<br/>
    <p><em>
        NB: Unfortunately Upstairs at The Sekforde is not wheelchair accessible
as there are stairs up to the room.<br/>
    </em></p>
<br/>
    <h4>
        == By Tube: ==<br/>
    </h4>
<br/>
    <p>
        For anyone on the Elizabeth Line we recommend travelling to Farringdon
and using its Barbican exit (not the Farringdon exit). It will spit you out
right next to Charterhouse Square (either on Lindsey Street or Hayne Street) ,
both of which lead onto the Square which is lit almost entirely with gas lamps.
The exact opposite of electricity!</p><br/>
<br/>
    <p>    
        If you are coming to Farringdon via rail or tube you can also walk all
the way through (within the station) to the Elizabeth Line exit but you may be
charged more if touching in on tube/rail and touching out on Elizabeth.<br/>
    </p>
<br/>
    <h4>
        == By Bus: ==<br/>
    </h4>
    <p>The 153 bus runs along nearby St John Street. The nearest stops are -
        Aylesbury Street, #54246 or Percival Street (Stop UJ), #55543 (heading
towards Finsbury Park) St. John Street Clerkenwell Rd, #53751 (heading towards
Liverpool Street)<br/>
    </p>
    <p>The 55 and 253 buses also serve Clerkenwell Road.</p>
<br/>
    <h4>Or just use CityMapper or whatever...</h4>
