<br />Echo Horn
<br /> If you go to Bodiam Castle; you can experience Splash and Ripple’s “A Knight’s Peril” by taking an “Echo Horn” around the castle to listen to the echoes in the walls of the castle - and maybe help avert a murder!

Tarim will be talking about the hardware, software, Raspberry Pis and Minirigs that go to make up an Echo Horn.
