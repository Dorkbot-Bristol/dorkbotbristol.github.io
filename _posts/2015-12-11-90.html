see who's coming <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/445127949015483/">via the Facebook event</a>, if that's your thing

With speakers including - but not restricted to...

<b>==== Rain Ashford ====</b>
<b>"Designing, coding and building sensor-driven emotive wearables
to amplify physiological data in social situations"</b>
<a href="https://rainycatz.wordpress.com/">https://rainycatz.wordpress.com/</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/rainycat/">https://twitter.com/rainycat/</a>
From her AnemoneStarHeart EEG / ECG visualising device to the
ThinkerBelle EEG Amplifying Dress, Rain's doctoral research
investigates how wearable technology could broadcast physiological
data from the body to create new forms of non-verbal communication,
and questions the personal, societal and cultural implications.

<b>==== Julie Freeman ====</b>
<b>"Do Naked Mole Rats have data privacy rights?"</b>
(NB no burrowing eusocial mammals were harmed during the course of this research)

For the past 15 years Julie has questioned the use of electronic technologies
to ‘translate nature’ – whether through the sound of torrential rain dripping
on a giant rhubarb leaf; a pair of mobile concrete speakers who lurk in galleries
spewing sonic samples, by providing an interactive platform from which to view
the flap, twitch and prick of dogs’ ears; or using scientific techniques to 
misguide an audience to manipulate their senses. 

<b>==== Mike Harrison ====</b>
<b>"Talk title TBC"</b>

Dorkbot regular Mike is a Freelance Electronics Engineer (and Youtuber), recently returned
from installing a large-scale LED display in Hong Kong.

<b>==== Open dorks: ====</b>
(...perhaps you?)

<b>==== Youtube-powered DORK KARAOKE: ====</b>
The evening concludes with (non-compulsory) "Dork Karaoke" of songs we can find
(or ideally download in advance) via Youtube. Please submit your requests via
<a href="https://twitter.com/DorkbotLondon">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/445127949015483/">the Facebook event</a> - they don't have to be particularly dorky or Xmas-y,
but ideally they should be short (<4-5min), reasonably well-known, and not highly offensive. Cheers!
