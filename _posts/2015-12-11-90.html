<b>==== Rain Ashford ====</b>
<b>"Designing, coding and building sensor-driven emotive wearables
to amplify physiological data in social situations"</b>
<a href="https://rainycatz.wordpress.com/">https://rainycatz.wordpress.com/</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/rainycat/">https://twitter.com/rainycat/</a>
From her AnemoneStarHeart EEG / ECG visualising device to the
ThinkerBelle EEG Amplifying Dress, Rain's doctoral research
investigates how wearable technology could broadcast physiological
data from the body to create new forms of non-verbal communication,
and questions the personal, societal and cultural implications.

<b>==== Bob Sturm ====</b>
<b>“Eight short outputs …”</b>
<a href="http://highnoongmt.wordpress.com">highnoongmt.wordpress.com</a>/

Bob will play a compositional suite generated using a long short-term memory 
network with three fully connected hidden layers of 512 units each, trained on 
over 23,000 ABC transcriptions of session music (Irish, English, etc.), and 
arranged by his own “personal” neural network trained on who knows what for 
who knows how long (he can’t remember any of the settings) (2015). And he’ll
attempt to explain a little about them too.

<b>==== Julie Freeman ====</b>

<b>==== Youtube-powered DORK KARAOKE with @fakedavegreen ====</b>
The evening concludes with (non-compulsory) "Dork Karaoke" of songs we can find
(or ideally download in advance) off of Youtube. Please post your requests via
<a href="https://twitter.com/DorkbotLondon">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/445127949015483/">the Facebook event</a> - they don't have to be particularly dorky or Xmas-y,
but ideally they should be short (<4-5min), fairly well-known, and not highly offensive. Cheers!
