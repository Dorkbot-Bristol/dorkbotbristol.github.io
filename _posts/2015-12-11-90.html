<br/>
<i>"Designing, coding and building sensor-driven emotive wearables
to amplify physiological data in social situations"</i><br/>
From her AnemoneStarHeart EEG / ECG visualising device to the ThinkerBelle EEG<br/>
Amplifying Dress, Rain's doctoral research investigates how wearable technology<br/>
could broadcast physiological data from the body to create new forms of<br/>
non-verbal communication, and questions the personal, societal and cultural<br/>
implications.<br/>
<br/>

<b><b>==== Bob Sturm (<a href="https://twitter.com/boblsturm">@boblsturm</a>) ====</b></b>

<br/>
<i>“Eight short outputs …”</i>
Bob will play a compositional suite generated using a long short-term memory<br/>
network with three fully connected hidden layers of 512 units each, trained on<br/>
over 23,000 ABC transcriptions of session music (Irish, English, etc.), and<br/>
arranged by his own “personal” neural network trained on who knows what for who<br/>
knows how long (he can’t remember any of the settings) (2015). And he’ll attempt<br/>
to explain a little about them too.<br/>
<br/>

<b><b>==== Plus Special Guest... Di Mainstone! (<a href="http://twitter.com/dimainstone">@dimainstone</a>) ====</b></b>
<a href="http://dimainstone.com/">dimainstone.com</a>
<br/>
After speaking at our last event, Di discusses new plans for creating sound and<br/>
music from any suitably resonant metal structures...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b><b>==== Sputnik Bauble Workshop and "Competition" ====</b></b>
Hosted by <a href='https://twitter.com/jonty'>@jonty</a> &amp; <a
href='https://twitter.com/prehensile'>@prehensile</a>, this essentially involves
sticking four bits<br/>
of wire to a shiny silver bauble in order to make a 1/10th scale Sputnik-themed<br/>
decoration for your festive celebrations. We will be providing baubles, wire<br/>
and glue.<br/>
<br/>
Prizes may well be awarded* for the most overengineered bauble. If you feel<br/>
inspired to go beyond the baseline Sputnik bauble, you've got a 55mm-diameter<br/>
spherical volume to fill with whatever you see fit.<br/>
<br/>
<small>* Prizes may well be more baubles. We've got a lot of baubles.</small>
<br/>
<b><b>==== Youtube-powered DORK KARAOKE with <a href='https://twitter.com/fakedavegreen'>@fakedavegreen</a> ====</b></b>
The evening concludes with (non-compulsory) "Dork Karaoke" of songs we can find<br/>
(or ideally download in advance) off of Youtube. Please post your requests via<br/>
Twitter or the Facebook event - they don't have to be particularly dorky or<br/>
Xmas-y, but ideally they should be short (<4-5min), fairly well-known, and not<br/>
highly offensive. Cheers!<br/>
