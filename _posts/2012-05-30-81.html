Featuring the dazzling and mellifluous...<br/>
<br/>
- The Diasynchronoscope (<a

- Bruno Mathez and Carol MacGillivray<br/>
<br/>
    The Diasynchronoscope project is a joint artistic adventure in a whole new<br/>
    medium of choreographed time. The name Diasynchronoscope comes from
combining<br/>
    diachronic, (the study of a phenomenon as it changes through time) with<br/>
    synchronous and scope (view). In being so named, it evokes the early
animation<br/>
    simulators such as the phenakistoscope and the zoetrope which we regard as<br/>
    direct ancestors of the project acting both as art objects and experimental<br/>
    media.<br/>

- Projection-mapping projects (<a

- Evan Raskob<br/>
<br/>
    Evan will show some of his open source projection-mapping work developed as<br/>
    part of his residency at Ravensbourne this year, and for an upcoming Openlab<br/>
    Workshops (<a
href="http://openlabworkshops.org/">http://openlabworkshops.org/</a>) workshop.
To put this in context, Evan<br/>
    will explore a little history of projecting on non-rectangular things, and<br/>
    how/why the physical world is becoming yet another computer screen.<br/>
<br/>
- Sound Circuit (<a
href="http://simonkatan.co.uk/">http://simonkatan.co.uk/</a>)<br/>
- Simon Katan<br/>
<br/>
    Simon will demo his visual sequencer Sound Circuit, built in OpenFrameworks<br/>
    and inspired by the impossible spaces found in the two dimensional graphics
of<br/>
    early computer games such as Asteroids and Pacman.  Rather than employing a<br/>
    conventional studio-derived layout, a virtual tape-head travels through a,
two<br/>
    dimensional, wrapped space along tracks that can be freely inter-connected
with<br/>
    sonic events being represented an array of animated graphics, which are<br/>
    triggered as the tape head passes over them. With various algorithms guiding
the<br/>
    tape-head through the resultant network, the topological layout of the
tracks<br/>
    directly influence the macro form of the music.<br/>
