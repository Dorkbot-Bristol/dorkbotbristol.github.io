Featuring the dazzling and mellifluous...

- The Diasynchronoscope (<a href="http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/diasynchronoscope/?p=260">http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/diasynchronoscope/?p=260</a>)
- Bruno Mathez and Carol MacGillivray

    The Diasynchronoscope project is a joint artistic adventure in a whole new
    medium of choreographed time. The name Diasynchronoscope comes from combining
    diachronic, (the study of a phenomenon as it changes through time) with
    synchronous and scope (view). In being so named, it evokes the early animation
    simulators such as the phenakistoscope and the zoetrope which we regard as
    direct ancestors of the project acting both as art objects and experimental
    media.

- Projection-mapping projects (<a href="http://github.com/pixelpusher/CreativeCode">http://github.com/pixelpusher/CreativeCode</a>)
- Evan Raskob

    Evan will show some of his open source projection-mapping work developed as
    part of his residency at Ravensbourne this year, and for an upcoming Openlab
    Workshops (<a href="http://openlabworkshops.org/">http://openlabworkshops.org/</a>) workshop. To put this in context, Evan
    will explore a little history of projecting on non-rectangular things, and
    how/why the physical world is becoming yet another computer screen.

- Sound Circuit (<a href="http://simonkatan.co.uk/">http://simonkatan.co.uk/</a>)
- Simon Katan

    Simon will demo his visual sequencer Sound Circuit, built in OpenFrameworks
    and inspired by the impossible spaces found in the two dimensional graphics of
    early computer games such as Asteroids and Pacman.  Rather than employing a
    conventional studio-derived layout, a virtual tape-head travels through a, two
    dimensional, wrapped space along tracks that can be freely inter-connected with
    sonic events being represented an array of animated graphics, which are
    triggered as the tape head passes over them. With various algorithms guiding the
    tape-head through the resultant network, the topological layout of the tracks
    directly influence the macro form of the music.
