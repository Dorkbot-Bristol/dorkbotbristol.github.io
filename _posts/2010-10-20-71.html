<li><strong><a href="http://enigmaker.org/">The Paradox of Public Domain Invention</a></strong>
 - Cefn Hoile
<br />Cefn Hoile presents the Enigmaker project, a model of public-domain
invention inspired by open source hardware and software. Over two
months in a mobile-home-lab, a new invention a week was documented.
Only one detail of each prototype was left out - what&#39;s it for? Visitors
and twitter users were invited to make their guesses. Enigmaker&#39;s
#project3 was a laser-cut, perpetual 4-week-horizon wall planner.
The &#39;Tacticalendar&#39; is now ready for production. The first batch has been
mailed to customers, with the design simultaneously published under a
creative commons license.
