<li><strong><a href="http://enigmaker.org/">The Paradox of Public Domain Invention</a></strong>
 - Cefn Hoile<br/>
<br />Cefn Hoile presents the Enigmaker project, a model of public-domain
invention inspired by open source hardware and software. Over two<br/>
months in a mobile-home-lab, a new invention a week was documented.<br/>
Only one detail of each prototype was left out - what&#39;s it for? Visitors<br/>
and twitter users were invited to make their guesses. Enigmaker&#39;s<br/>
#project3 was a laser-cut, perpetual 4-week-horizon wall planner.<br/>
The &#39;Tacticalendar&#39; is now ready for production. The first batch has
been<br/>
mailed to customers, with the design simultaneously published under a<br/>
creative commons license.<br/>
