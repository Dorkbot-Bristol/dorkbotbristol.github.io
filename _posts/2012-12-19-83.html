Liam Donovan: Two projects, maybe more
- a talking guitar and a barely working self-typing type-writer

Rachel Freire: Imogen Heap's Musical Gloves
- think minority report for musicians brought to you by the DIY/maker
  revolution.

Jokubas Dargis: Echo
- A game where you collect, recycle and destroy sounds on your way to
  the king of space, and possibly other adventures.

And open dorks from:

Tim Monsees Stubnitz Projections
- the experience and challenges of a multi-projector setup on a ship
  (work in progress)
