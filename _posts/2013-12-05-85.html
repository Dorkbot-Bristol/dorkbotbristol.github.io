Rob Phillips speaks about bees & labs and DIY tech:<br/>
<br/>
The BeeLab project is a partnership between Horizon Digital Economy Research<br/>
<a href="http://www.horizon.ac.uk/">(http://www.horizon.ac.uk/)</a>, Robert Phillips <a href="http://www.rdphillips.co.uk/">(http://www.rdphillips.co.uk/)</a>,
Technology Will Save Us <a
href="http://technologywillsaveus.org/">(http://technologywillsaveus.org/)</a>,
The Honey Club<br/>
(<a href="http://honeyclub.org/">http://honeyclub.org/</a>) and The British
Beekeepers Association<br/>
<a href="http://www.bbka.org.uk/">(http://www.bbka.org.uk/)</a>, the project aims to enable the beekeeping community
to enhance the care for bees by harnessing the power of open design, DIY<br/>
technology and citizen science.<br/>
<br/>
Over the past few months, Bee Lab has put on a series of hackdays bringing<br/>
together technologists, product designers and engineers to work with beekeepers<br/>
to co-create customisable, monitoring devices that can be inserted into hives to<br/>
sense different signals for the beekeeper to read – including frame or feeder<br/>
weight, whole hive weight, temperature and humidity. The idea is that the more<br/>
that the bees can communicate to their beekeeper, the more the beekeeper can<br/>
understand and respond to them without even opening up the hive.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Nick Rothwell (<a href="http://cassiel.com/">http://cassiel.com/</a>) discusses
his recent array of projects<br/>
possibly including Arduino-connected-to-web-servers, John Whitney's generative<br/>
works, cancer-related art for the Wellcome Trust, and using Clojure, Field, &<br/>
Overtone.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Camille Baker (<a
href="http://www.swampgirl67.net/">http://www.swampgirl67.net/</a>) expounds on
upcoming events and ways<br/>
artists and techies can get involved and put in proposals for the residencies<br/>
they can be apart of over the next few months:<br/>
<br/>
ICT & ART Connect (<a
href="http://www.ict-art-connect.eu/about/">http://www.ict-art-connect.eu/about/</a>)
sets out to bring<br/>
together artists and technologists to explore new ways of working.<br/>
Collaborative acts of co-creation, together with an open and multidisciplinary<br/>
discussion, will foster the bringing together of art and technology.  Recurring<br/>
open calls for residencies will be offered to pairings willing to contribute a<br/>
pilot project to the initiative. Moreover, all events will provide a space of<br/>
discussion and creation through multidisciplinary round-tables, workshops,<br/>
‘hackathons’ and demonstrations.<br/>
