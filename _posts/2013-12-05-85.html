Rob Phillips speaks about bees & labs and DIY tech:

The BeeLab project is a partnership between Horizon Digital Economy Research
<a href="http://www.horizon.ac.uk/">(http://www.horizon.ac.uk/)</a>, Robert Phillips <a href="http://www.rdphillips.co.uk/">(http://www.rdphillips.co.uk/)</a>,
Technology Will Save Us <a href="http://technologywillsaveus.org/">(http://technologywillsaveus.org/)</a>, The Honey Club
(<a href="http://honeyclub.org/">http://honeyclub.org/</a>) and The British Beekeepers Association
<a href="http://www.bbka.org.uk/">(http://www.bbka.org.uk/)</a>, the project aims to enable the beekeeping community
to enhance the care for bees by harnessing the power of open design, DIY
technology and citizen science.

Over the past few months, Bee Lab has put on a series of hackdays bringing
together technologists, product designers and engineers to work with beekeepers
to co-create customisable, monitoring devices that can be inserted into hives to
sense different signals for the beekeeper to read – including frame or feeder
weight, whole hive weight, temperature and humidity. The idea is that the more
that the bees can communicate to their beekeeper, the more the beekeeper can
understand and respond to them without even opening up the hive.



Nick Rothwell (<a href="http://cassiel.com/">http://cassiel.com/</a>) discusses his recent array of projects
possibly including Arduino-connected-to-web-servers, John Whitney's generative
works, cancer-related art for the Wellcome Trust, and using Clojure, Field, &
Overtone.



Camille Baker (<a href="http://www.swampgirl67.net/">http://www.swampgirl67.net/</a>) expounds on upcoming events and ways
artists and techies can get involved and put in proposals for the residencies
they can be apart of over the next few months:

ICT & ART Connect (<a href="http://www.ict-art-connect.eu/about/">http://www.ict-art-connect.eu/about/</a>) sets out to bring
together artists and technologists to explore new ways of working.
Collaborative acts of co-creation, together with an open and multidisciplinary
discussion, will foster the bringing together of art and technology.  Recurring
open calls for residencies will be offered to pairings willing to contribute a
pilot project to the initiative. Moreover, all events will provide a space of
discussion and creation through multidisciplinary round-tables, workshops,
‘hackathons’ and demonstrations.
