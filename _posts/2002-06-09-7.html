<li><strong>dorkestra</strong>

<br />This meeting was part of the Mute/NTK xcom2002 thing, so it didn&#39;t follow the normal dorkbotlondon format. Strange electrical instruments / software / abused home appliances were brought, powered up and (sort of) played. An hour or so of wonderful noise went down a treat.
