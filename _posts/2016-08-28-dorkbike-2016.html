Another excellent suggestion from Gordon Joly, this year's "Dorkbike" is a (fairly) easy cycle trip
from Harold Wood station (26 min by train from Stratford) to <a href="http://www.secretnuclearbunker.com/secret-nuclear-bunker-admissions.php/">the Kelvedon Hatch nuclear bunker in Essex</a>
- this info also available on the <a href="">Facebook event</a> if you want to see who's coming...

START TIME: Aim to meet before noon on Platform 8 at Stratford station, to catch the  
<a href="http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/SRA/HRO/280816/1200/dep#outwardJump">12:12 train to Harold Wood (final stop Shenfield)</a>
(Latecomers can catch the 12:21 from Platform 10A, which arrives only a few minutes later but tends to
be busier with people going - presumably - to Southend.)

MAIN RIDE: From Harold Wood station to nuclear bunker, via the quiet/ mostly hill-avoiding route shown
below, arriving around 1.30-1.40pm. Approx 9 miles but it still has a couple of hills...

RETURN ROUTE: After say 1-2 hours at the bunker, the simplest (less hilly) way back is to take Ongar Road 
to Brentwood - although this is a main road, it doesn't have many large trucks etc on Sundays. There's 
also the option of stopping at <a href="http://www.themerchantbrentwood.co.uk/">The Merchant pub</a> on Brentwood High Street.

COSTS: The bunker (inc audio tour) is adults: £7.00, kids: £5 (5-16), family £16.50 (2 adults, 2 kids).
Train fare is quoted as £4.20 from Stratford to Harold Wood (though it might be cheaper on Oyster or if
you get a cheap day return to Brentwood).
"Unfortunately [the nuclear bunker people] are unable to take credit/debit cards."

Not got a bike? You could potentially meet us by car or foot around 1.30pm at the nuclear bunker
(annoyingly the <a href="http://www.ensignbus.com/route-21.html">local bus service from Epping or Brentwood</a> doesn't run on Sundays). 

NB: You are responsible for your own safety and personal possessions at all
times - always be aware of potential hazards and other cyclists and pedestrians. 
Don't forget to bring a proper bike lock and spare inner tube if you can get one
- plus food and drink unless you want to rely on cafes at the various stopping
points. There are toilets at Stratford station and at the nuclear bunker as well.

APPROX ROUTE: 
(this is essentially Google maps' suggested cycling route from Harold Wood Station Car Park to
Kelvedon Hatch Secret Nuclear Bunker, but skipping some hills via Horseman Side. We can also use 
the dirt tracks/bridlepaths</a> of <a href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/route-136">Cycle Route 136</a> instead of the roads up to Noak Hill...)
