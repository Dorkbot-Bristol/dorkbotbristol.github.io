Another excellent suggestion from Gordon Joly, this year's "Dorkbike" is a (fairly) easy cycle trip
from Harold Wood station (26 min by train from Stratford) to <a href="http://www.secretnuclearbunker.com/secret-nuclear-bunker-admissions.php/">the Kelvedon Hatch nuclear bunker in Essex</a>:
and a <a href="">Facebook event</a> if you want to see who's coming...

START TIME: Aim to meet before noon on Platform 8 at Stratford station, to catch the  
<a href="http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/SRA/HRO/280816/1200/dep#outwardJump">12:12	train to Harold Wood (final stop Shenfield)</a>
(Latecomers can catch the 12:21 from Platfrom 10A, which arrives only a few minutes later but tends to be busier
with people going - presumably - to Southend.)

MAIN RIDE: from Harold Wood station to nuclear bunker, via the quiet/ mostly hill-avoiding route below, arriving around 1.30-1.40pm.

Train fare is quoted as Â£4.20 from Stratford to Harold Wood (though it might be cheaper on Oyster or if you get a cheap day return to Brentwood)

Not got a bike? You could potentially meet us by foot or car around 1.30pm at the nuclear bunker.

NB: You are responsible for your own safety and personal possessions at all
times - always be aware of potential hazards and other cyclists and pedestrians. 
Don't forget to bring a proper bike lock and spare inner tube if you can get one
- plus food and drink unless you want to rely on cafes at the various stopping
points. There are toilets at Stratford station and at the nuclear bunker as well.
