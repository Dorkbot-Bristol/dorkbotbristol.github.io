Another excellent suggestion from Gordon Joly, this year's "Dorkbike" is a
(fairly) easy cycle trip<br/>
from Harold Wood station (26 min by train from Stratford) to <a
href="http://www.secretnuclearbunker.com/secret-nuclear-bunker-admissions.php/">the
Kelvedon Hatch nuclear bunker in Essex</a><br/>
- this info will also be available on a <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/events/316560668678227/">Facebook event</a> if
you want to see who's coming...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Obviously this event is weather dependent, if it looks like consistent heavy rain then we'll
probably postpone to a later date - please check the <a
href="https://twitter.com/DorkbotLondon">DorkbotLondon twitter page</a> for
updates<br/>
or text/call Dave Green on 07742 711 026.</i><br/>
<br/>
START TIME: Aim to meet before noon on Platform 8 at Stratford station, to catch
the<br/>
<a href="http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/SRA/HRO/280816/1200/dep#outwardJump">12:12 train to Harold Wood (final stop Shenfield)</a>
(Latecomers can catch the 12:21 from Platform 10A, which arrives only a few
minutes later but tends to<br/>
be busier with people going - presumably - to Southend.)<br/>
<br/>
MAIN RIDE: From Harold Wood station to nuclear bunker, via the quiet/ mostly
hill-avoiding route shown<br/>
below, arriving around 1.45pm. Approx 9 miles but it still has a couple of
hills...<br/>
<br/>
RETURN ROUTE: After say 1-2 hours at the bunker, the simplest (less hilly) way
back is to take Ongar Road<br/>
to Brentwood - although this is a main road, it doesn't have many large trucks
etc on Sundays. There's<br/>
also the option of stopping at <a
href="http://www.themerchantbrentwood.co.uk/">The Merchant pub</a> on Brentwood
High Street.<br/>
<br/>
COSTS: The bunker (inc audio tour) is adults: £7.00, kids: £5 (5-16), family
£16.50 (2 adults, 2 kids).<br/>
Train fare from Stratford (zone 2) to Harold Wood (zone 6) is quoted as £4.20
(apparently only £2.40<br/>
one-way on Oyster/contactless, or £7.50 for a return to Brentwood - zone 9!).<br/>
"Unfortunately [the nuclear bunker people] are unable to take credit/debit
cards."<br/>
<br/>
Not got a bike? You could potentially meet us by car or foot before 2pm at the
nuclear bunker<br/>
(annoyingly the <a href="http://www.ensignbus.com/route-21.html">local bus
service from Epping or Brentwood</a> doesn't run on Sundays).<br/>
<br/>
NB: You are responsible for your own safety and personal possessions at all<br/>
times - always be aware of potential hazards and other cyclists and pedestrians.<br/>
Don't forget to bring a proper bike lock and spare inner tube if you can get one<br/>
- plus food and drink unless you want to rely on cafes at the various stopping<br/>
points. There are toilets at Stratford station and at the nuclear bunker as
well.<br/>
<br/>
APPROX ROUTE:<br/>
(this is essentially Google maps' <a
href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/Harold+Wood+Station+Car+Park,+Romford,+United+Kingdom/Kelvedon+Hatch+Secret+Nuclear+Bunker,+Kelvedon+Hall+Lane,+Kelvedon+Hatch,+Brentwood+CM14+5TL,+United+Kingdom/">suggested
cycling route</a> from Harold Wood Station Car Park to<br/>
Kelvedon Hatch Secret Nuclear Bunker, but skipping some hills via Horseman Side.
We can also use<br/>
the dirt tracks/bridlepaths</a> of <a
href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/route-136">Cycle Route 136</a>
instead of the roads up to Noak Hill...)<br/>
