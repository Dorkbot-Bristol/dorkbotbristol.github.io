The world's latest London Dorkbot comes to the Greenwich Peninsula courtest of<br/>
Stream Arts.  Come listen to your favourite Dorks and drink some Meantime beers<br/>
with us! All proceeds go to help Stream Arts (a registered arts charity) pay for<br/>
its space and fund future events.<br/>
<br/>
Featuring:<br/>
<br/>
Sarah Angliss:<br/>
"A demo some of my latest work. I'm attempting to imbue non-figurative objects<br/>
with minimal human animacy to create something that's uncanny but not obviously<br/>
humanlike - and to find odd but intuitive couplings between everyday objects and<br/>
music. A little bit about it here: <a

"An opendork about my Arduino MIDI 'fully programmable open hardware 8-bit<br/>
keyboard… for less than £30' with new features since London Maker Faire etc<br/>

Henry Cooke:<br/>
Faces in the Cloud is an automated experiment in machine pareidolia by Henry<br/>
Cooke. Henry will be talking about how he ended up making it, the processes it<br/>
uses and what edge-cases of computer perception can teach us about their and our<br/>
perceptive systems. <a
