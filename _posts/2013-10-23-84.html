The world's latest London Dorkbot comes to the Greenwich Peninsula courtest of
Stream Arts.  Come listen to your favourite Dorks and drink some Meantime beers
with us! All proceeds go to help Stream Arts (a registered arts charity) pay for
its space and fund future events.

Featuring:

Sarah Angliss:
"A demo some of my latest work. I'm attempting to imbue non-figurative objects
with minimal human animacy to create something that's uncanny but not obviously
humanlike - and to find odd but intuitive couplings between everyday objects and
music. A little bit about it here: <a href="http://www.sarahangliss.com/robots/trace">http://www.sarahangliss.com/robots/trace</a>"

Dave Green:
"An opendork about my Arduino MIDI 'fully programmable open hardware 8-bit
keyboard… for less than £30' with new features since London Maker Faire etc

Evan Raskob:
The Cross-Squawk project & making mechanical birds & class warfare.

Henry Cooke:
Faces in the Cloud is an automated experiment in machine pareidolia by Henry
Cooke. Henry will be talking about how he ended up making it, the processes it
uses and what edge-cases of computer perception can teach us about their and our
perceptive systems. <a href="http://facesinthecloud.tumblr.com/">http://facesinthecloud.tumblr.com/</a>

Mike Harrison:
Something to do with "Acoustic levitation!"

And maybe more OpenDorks!
