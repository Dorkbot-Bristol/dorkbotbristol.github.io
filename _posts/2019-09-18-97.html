"Spoke: the future as a board game. A science fiction storytelling game for
teens and adults"

Spoke is a board game for understanding complex futures. It can be played by
individuals or mixed groups. Players collaboratively conjure up future
narratives using prompts from story element cards and the board. The cards and
board form a distributed science fiction world that players can inhabit and
shape to fit their own imaginations. Story elements are based on diverse
characters, current research topics and events around the rise of automated
manufacturing, social media, machine learning and AI.

Spoke is designed for fun, futurists, scenario planners, educators and anyone
else exploring the uncertain world of the nearly possible.
