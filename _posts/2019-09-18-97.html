"Spoke: the future as a board game. A science fiction storytelling game for<br/>
teens and adults"<br/>
<br/>
Spoke is a board game for understanding complex futures. It can be played by<br/>
individuals or mixed groups. Players collaboratively conjure up future<br/>
narratives using prompts from story element cards and the board. The cards and<br/>
board form a distributed science fiction world that players can inhabit and<br/>
shape to fit their own imaginations. Story elements are based on diverse<br/>
characters, current research topics and events around the rise of automated<br/>
manufacturing, social media, machine learning and AI.<br/>
<br/>
Spoke is designed for fun, futurists, scenario planners, educators and anyone<br/>
else exploring the uncertain world of the nearly possible.<br/>
