<b>DORKMAS 2019!</b>

It's Christmas, so time for an extra special Dorkbot - we'll have talks,
music, and a bar.

Free entry, no registration required. Talks start 7.30pm, doors from
6.45pm. We'll probably run later than a regular Dorkbot.

Please feel free to bring interesting things along to show others - things
you've built, things to play, or curiosities to discuss.

Don't forget to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2392535060997651/">attend the Facebook event</a>, <a href="http://dorkbotlondon.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c64ae7bbb8eb1249be8ca8fa6&id=e2a9f9039c">join our mailing list</a>, 
and <a href='https://twitter.com/DorkbotLondon'>follow us on Twitter</a>.


With short talks from...

"3615 MUSEUM"

Digital design! What the hell is it? And why would a museum be interested in
it? It's pretty important that we try to make sense of how we got here, from
early french sex chat rooms on adorable plastic terminals, to Barbie dolls that
spy on you, to misogynistic computer adverts and 3D printed speculums. Natalie
will take you through the challenges we face in preserving, accessing and
understanding our digital heritage, and there will only be a tiny bit of
theory, promise.

<b>==== Jack Armitage ====</b>

"Craft in digital musical instrument design"

Investigations into reframing digital musical instrument design as a tactile
and embodied craft practice.

In this short talk I will review some of my PhD research in the domain of
digital musical instrument design, sometimes known as digital lutherie. Despite
my background in engineering, technology and startups, and my music practice in
live coding, I have spent recent years attempting to deconstruct the
techno-centric perspective that dominates contemporary musical instrument
making. Through interviewing violin luthiers and devising craft workshops for
so-called "digital luthiers", I have been seeking out paths towards tactile and
embodied forms of digital craft, which I recently began referring to as hybrid
lutherie. Right now I am recruiting for my final study, and I will conclude by
offering a preview of the activity involved and invite attendees to participate
in the research.
