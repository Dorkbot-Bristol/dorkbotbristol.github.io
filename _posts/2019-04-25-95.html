collaboration and the ingenuity that Dorkbot may bring.

"Tell Me I Can Fix This On My Own: songwriting with code as a non-programmer"

How accidentally live-coding an album let one woman fall back in love with
learning to program, and how (maybe) it can do the same for you.

"Parallax"

Parallax is a movement-based interactive VR artwork. The audience communicate
with one another by intuitively performing hand expressions and gestures that
sculpt a shared malleable object existing in the virtual space between them.

Dr Nicola Plant is a movement artist, coder and researcher with a PhD in Media
Art and Technology at the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer
Science, Queen Mary University of London.

"Boberg 1"

Boberg 1. is a hands-on interplay between material and computational
properties,  where music is composed through visual means. In a performance,
physical objects are translated into sounds and controlled through manual
calibration.

The Connected Seeds Library is a community seed library that lives at
