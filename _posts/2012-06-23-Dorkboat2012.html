To celebrate Alan Turing's 100th birthday, June's Dorkbotlondon will happen on a boat. At 4:45pm on Saturday 23rd June 2012,  We'll be sailing from Westminster pier, passing by Tower Bridge and then to Kew, while enjoying dorkboat presentations by people doing strange things with electricity. There might be a prize for the best Turing costume.

When we get to Kew we'll head across the bridge to the Waterman's gallery for some curry and a geek cabaret, then more presentations and performances and a wander around the latest exhibition at their  International Festival of Digital Arts (http://bit.ly/IQ7B9O)

This is limited to 90 *advance tickets only*, available here:https://dorkboat.eventwax.com/dorkboat-2012/ (they sell quick!)

Â£19.99 including the boat trip and an Indian buffet dinner, and discounted entry to the BEAM festival that weekend!*
