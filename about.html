First there was <a href="http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotnyc/">dorkbotnyc</a>, a monthly meeting of electronic artists in new york:
</pre>

<pre>
    "dorkbotnyc is a monthly meeting of artists (sound / image / movement /
    whatever), designers, engineers, students and other interested parties from
    the new york area who are involved in the creation of electronic art (in the
    broadest sense of the term.)"

Some people realised that their home city of London was in dire need of such a
meeting, and dorkbotlondon was born. We've had &gt;85 meetings, all well attended
by some great people.

If you're not in London, UK then why not see if there is a <a href="http://dorkbot.org">dorkbot near you</a>?
They're springing up everywhere...
