    ==== How to get to Limehouse Town Hall: ====

    == By Tube:
    Limehouse DLR from Bank or Tower Gateway

    == By Bus:
    15 from Trafalgar Sq / 115 from Aldgate /
    D6 from Hackney / D3 from Bethnal Green

    Get onto Commercial Road and travel East from Aldgate or Whitechapel.
    Stay on Commercial Road, passing Limehouse DLR on your right (and
    going under a railway bridge) and you'll see a modern red brick church
    also on the right, then a boarded up library. Just over the canal you'll
    see the TownHall, with the Limehouse Hawksmoor church behind it. At this
    point you should get off the bus/bicycle and come ring on the "Boxing Club"
    bell (The top of the 4 main buttons).
