<p>This is a modified version of the EMF Camp Code of Conduct (accessed 12/23) licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License</p>

<p>Sadly, technology events have a notorious reputation for harassment. We've set these ground rules to make it abundantly clear that this kind of behaviour is not acceptable, so that everyone can feel comfortable attending Dorkbot. Everybody in the Dorkbot community is required to abide by this code of conduct at the event and on any online channels.</p>

<h2>The Rules</h2>

<p>We do not tolerate abuse, harassment, or discriminatory behaviour of any form. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Do not engage in homophobic, biphobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise prejudiced behaviour.</li>
    <li>Do not harass people. Stalking, unconsented physical contact, threatening behaviour, and unwanted sexual attention is harassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.</li>
    <li>Everyone's personal space is their own. If you are asked to leave someone alone you must respect this.</li>
    <li>People may not want to be filmed or photographed. You must have consent from anyone who is identifiable in a photo or video.</li>
    <li>Sexualised language and imagery is not appropriate in public, or in sessions which do not deal directly with such topics.</li>
    <li>Aggression and elitism are not welcome â€” do not belittle people for their knowledge or experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting an Incident</h2>

<p>If you are being harassed or witness a breach of this code of conduct, you can get in touch with us:</p>

<ul>
    <li>In person by telling an organiser.</li>
    <li>By email to Oliver Child <a href="mailto:dorkbot@oliverchild.com">dorkbot@oliverchild.com</a>.</li>
    <li>By email to Robin Thorn <a href="mailto:dorkbot@thawney.com">dorkbot@thawney.com</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If one of the organisers is in breach of this code of conduct please inform another organiser or directly reach out to the venue where the event is taking place.</p>

<h2>Our Response</h2>

<p>If we believe you have violated this code of conduct, we will normally issue you with a warning, with which you are expected to comply. If your behaviour continues, we may eject you from the event and ban you from any online channels.</p>

<p>Serious breaches, including sexual or physical assault, will result in your immediate ejection from the event and a ban from all future events. We may involve the police if the victim wishes.</p>
